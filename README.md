## ✨ Pro Tips (style & animation ideas)
- Use `header.svg` (provided) — it’s a tiny animated cartoon that works well in profile READMEs.
- Add animated GIFs of app flows (record with OBS or screen-to-gif).
- Use shields.io badges for dynamic status (build passing, school projects, languages).
- For advanced animated headers, create an SVG and reference it: `![header](./header.svg)` — GitHub renders SVG animations.
